Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.


1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

Answer: This semester, I saw the power of function during the outdoor scene project. 
I was amazed to see that I could piece together an outdoor scene, put colours and add objects like the 
cloud, sun, birds simply by writing a workable function. 



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Answer: Test functions are invaluable to the work of a programmer as they make 
it easy to quickly assess if the functions are executable or not. Test function also
become handy as good debugging tool because the reports it gives when the test fail directly 
point to the particular source code of the error. Thus, pointing the programmer to the part of his code that needs to be debugged.  



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Answer: When I have a program that need troubleshooting or fixing, I usually follow the top-down troubleshooting, i.e,
first commenting the later part of the code out, then begin to test each session of the code to identify where the error might have started from. 
In my short programming career, I have come to realize that this method that I often use for troubleshootingi really cumbersome and time consuming. 
i think that I can improve this methon by learning and using test functions more frequently.

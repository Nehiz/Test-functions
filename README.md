# Test-functions (writing test functions and using pytest to run those functions to verify the correctness of previously written functions). 

#testwords.py: It verifies that the words.py prefix and suffix function (which return the prefix, and/or suffix if any, appear in both string1 and string2. In other words, it returns a string of the characters that appear at the beginning or end of both string1 and string2) works correctly.
